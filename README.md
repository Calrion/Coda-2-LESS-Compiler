====================

A LESS compiler for Coda 2

(Download the plugin here!)[https://github.com/mjvotaw/Coda-2-LESS-Compiler/raw/master/LESSCompile.codaplugin.zip]


Quick Rundown of how this thing here works
------------------------------------------

Before you can start compiling code all willy-nilly, you have to add your main less file to the plugin.
Go to LESS Compiler > Site Settings, and in the window click the little folder icon, and then select your less file.
